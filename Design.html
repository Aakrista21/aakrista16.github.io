            Within the concepts of sociology, cliques are a formation of two or more individuals who share bonding characteristics that allow for them to identify with one another to form a social network. Those within the group communicate and associate with one another more so than with those outside of the group.[4] The formation of cliques can be identified within different social environments throughout the course their lives. One person may be part of multiple cliques, each forming and functioning independently from one another. Cliques are relevant in society due to the social influence or peer pressure that results from the interactions with individuals who share a common characteristic. The outcomes associated with clique formations may be endless with varying degrees of influence.[5] So, a formal clique, such as a professional organization, would have a different kind of influence as compared to a social clique consisting of close friends.

            Social isolation
            In their article "Social Isolation In America",[6] Paolo Parigi and Warner Henson II define social isolation as "the degree of apartness of an entity; [which] may have structural or subjective interpretations."[7] Social isolation may occur when cliques set themselves apart from other groups.

            A clique can also involve a high degree of social commitment to a specific group. A stronger level of commitment results in an individual having a reduced amount of interaction with other social groups. Cliquish behaviour often involves repetition with regard to activities, vernacular, preferences and manner, which can result in conflict with other cliques, creating "outsiders". Individuals can also experience social isolation within their own clique if their values and/or behaviour begin to differ from the rest of the group.

            Members
            Different factors affect the way cliques are established and who is included within its membership. In some cases, people are subconsciously placed in a clique by association. For example, joining a basketball team usually causes others to automatically perceive you as an "athlete". Many people may gravitate toward a clique subconsciously through the way they are perceived or whom they may be associated with.

            Sharing similar interests is the most common way cliques are formed. As people interact with each other doing the simple things that they enjoy doing, they may find themselves drifting towards or becoming attracted to others that share the same passion. This usually causes one to gain confidence by being surrounded by people who share similar interests and it may cause an individual to feel more socially accepted.

            Ethnicity usually plays a role according to setting or time frame. In today's society race still is prevalent, and therefore, cliques solely based on race have been formed. One memorable example of such a clique could be the Ku Klux Klan, a notorious white supremacy group.

            Members of cliques often create their own distinct dress code and communicate with one another in a unique manner. As a result, this makes a clique unique and gives each member a reassuring feeling that they belong to that specific group. As these cliques come together it isn't hard to distinguish one from the other. For example, Deadheads, the followers of the band The Grateful Dead, identify one another with various forms of tie-dyed clothing.

            Interactions among members of a clique can also lead to organized social events, such as parties, significant dates, or private meetings. Clique members have a strong commitment to their respected group. In regards to this, being present at social events is seen as mandatory. Considering this, it shows the firmness of cliques and how people ultimately conform
